  "description": "This document outlines the design and functionality requirements for building a single-page marketing agency website based on the provided design mockups. The goal is to create a modern, clean, and engaging user experience with smooth animations and full responsiveness.",
  "generalInstructions": {
    "frameworkSuggestion": "React (Next.js) or a similar modern JavaScript framework is recommended for component-based architecture. Use a CSS-in-JS solution like Styled Components or a utility-first framework like Tailwind CSS for styling.",
    "responsiveness": {
      "target": "The website must be fully responsive and adapt seamlessly to all device sizes, from mobile phones (vertical) to desktops.",
      "behavior": "Grids (e.g., Services, Team) should stack into a single column on mobile devices. Font sizes and spacing should adjust accordingly. Ensure navigation is mobile-friendly, possibly using a hamburger menu.",
      "typography": "Follow the mobile-specific typography guidelines provided in the style guide."
    },
    "animations": {
      "onScroll": "Implement subtle fade-in or slide-in animations for sections and elements as the user scrolls down the page. This adds a dynamic feel.",
      "onHover": "All interactive elements (buttons, cards, links) should have clear hover states. For example, cards could slightly scale up or have a shadow effect. Buttons could change color or brightness.",
      "transitions": "Ensure all state changes, like the accordion expanding or hover effects, are smooth with a transition duration of approximately 0.3s."
    },
    "assetLinks": {
      "font": "The font used is 'Positivus'. A link is provided in the style guide image: 'You can find font here'. This should be implemented via `@font-face` or a font service.",
      "illustrations": "Illustrations are credited to 'Igor Kapustin' and 'vectorjuice on Freepik'. All illustrations from the mockups should be exported as optimized SVGs to ensure they are crisp and lightweight."
